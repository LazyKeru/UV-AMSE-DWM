# tp2

A new Flutter project.

## To do:

- [X] Exo 1
- [X] Exo 2
- [X] Exo 3
- [X] Exo 4 // Could rework it to my sauce
- [X] Exo 5
- [X] Exo 6
- [X] Exo 7

## Project general structure

- lib
- - main.dart : calls exo3 screen, which is our menu
- - screens : 1 screen for each exercice
- - utilities : function that I was able to externalise, could do a lot more
- - widgets :  class to generate big statful widget

## Comments

Still a lot of points I should look into, mostly for the last two exercices which I rushed. I wasn't able to highlight the tiles that a player could select. The code could be cleaner near the end and have more comments, as it would be hard to dive back in the project.
