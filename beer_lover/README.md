# lib_regex

This web mobile app is inspired by my first_app. It will be for my TP1. It is supposed to be a media management app, nevertheless. I love beer and would prefer a beer management app.

## app Structure:
- Home page
    - Beers
    - Beers that you've tasted
    - Beers that you've loved
